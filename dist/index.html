        <h1>Iceland</h1>
        <p>Iceland, a Nordic island nation, is defined by its dramatic landscape with volcanoes, geysers, hot springs and lava fields. Massive glaciers are protected in Vatnajökull and Snæfellsjökull national parks. Most of the population lives in the capital, Reykjavik, which runs on geothermal power and is home to the National and Saga museums, tracing Iceland’s Viking history.</p>

          <h1>Geography</h1>
          <p class="bg-light">From a geological standpoint, Iceland is a very young country, still in the midst of its own creation. Shaped by the forces of nature, the, barren landscapes demonstrate the creativity powers of the four basic elements—earth, air, fire, and water—in a dramatic way. Active volcanoes, bright green valleys, glacier-cut fjords, black sand beaches, and roaring rivers are the most distinctive features of the Icelandic landscape. And although they are very accessible, they still remain virtually untouched by human civilization. In a fast-paced world of sprawling development, Iceland's pure nature and empty expanses stand out as a luxury.</p>

          <h1>History</h1>
          <p class="bg-dark">Iceland apparently has no prehistory. According to stories written down some 250 years after the event, the country was discovered and settled by Norse people in the Viking Age. The oldest source, Íslendingabók (The Book of the Icelanders), written about 1130, sets the period of settlement at about 870–930 ce. The other main source, Landnámabók (The Book of Settlements), of 12th-century origin but known only in later versions, states explicitly that the first permanent settler, Ingólfr Arnarson, came from Norway to Iceland to settle in the year 874. He chose as his homestead a site that he named Reykjavík, which he farmed with his wife, Hallveig Fródadóttir. The Book of Settlements then enumerates more than 400 settlers who sailed with their families, servants, and slaves to Iceland to stake claims to land. Most of the settlers came from Norway, but some came from other Nordic countries and from the Norse Viking Age settlements in the British Isles.</p>

          <h1>Mountains</h1>
          <p class="bg-light">Iceland is filled with interesting rock sculptures, lava formations, volcanoes and mountains of all shapes and sizes. In the Westfjords you can find high table-top mountains with narrow fjords in between but the mountains by the fjords in the east of the country are more rugged and harsh. 

            The mountains in the Westfjords are older (about 10-16 million years old) and have been shaped through thousands of years of carrying heavy glaciers and battling with the natural elements, polishing off the rough edges. Younger mountains that have been formed when two tectonic plates crash into each other are rougher on the edges.
            
            Iceland is situated right on top of two tectonic plates and is also on one of the so-called hot spots on earth, with intense volcanic activity and frequent earthquakes happening.
            
            Volcanoes have many different types of lava, for example, smooth and fast running lava, thick and slowly crawling lava or spitting lava. These different types of lava will cool into different types of mountains, stones and rock formations with different textures, thickness, colours and weight. All in all, Iceland is the geologist’s paradise.</p>
